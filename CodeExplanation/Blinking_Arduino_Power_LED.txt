'#include <avr/io.h>'
This is a header file that contains code and definitions for the Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

'#include <util/delay.h>'
This is a header file that uses the CPU's clock frequency to calculate loop counts for the specified delay time.

'int main(void) {'
Defines the main fucntion and does not accept any arguments as inputs.

'DDRB |= (1 << DDB7);'
Calls the data direction register bus b and changes the 7th bit which corresponds to PORTB to a 1 setting it as an output.

'while(1) {'
A while loop that continues to run as long as the coniditions are true and any non zero values are true so this loop goes on forever. 

'PORTB |= (1 << PORTB7);'
Sets the B7 bit in PORTB to a 1 setting the voltage to high and turning on the power led.

'_delay_ms(1000);'
A function that delays the code by 1 second.

'PORTB &= ~(1 << PORTB7);'
Sets the B7 bit in PORTB to a 0 setting the voltage to low and turning off the power led.

'_delay_ms(1000);'
A function that delays the code by 1 second.

'}'
Closes the while loop.

'}'
Closes the main function.
