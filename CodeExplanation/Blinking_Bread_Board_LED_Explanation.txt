'#include <avr/io.h>'
This is a header file that contains code and definitions for the Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

'#include <util/delay.h>'
This is a header file that uses the CPU's clock frequency to calculate loop counts for the specified delay time.

'int main(void) {'
Initilizes the main fucntion and which is the entry point of the script.

'DDRB = 0;'
Sets all of the bits for each corresponding pin in the data direciton register b to 0.

'DDRA |= (1 << PA0);'
Calls the data direction register a and changes 1st bit which correspeonds to PORTA to a 1 setting it as an output.

'while(1) {'
A while loop that continues to run as long as the coniditions are true and any non zero values are true so this loop goes on forever.

'PORTA |= (1 << PA0);'
Sets the A0 bit in PORTA to a 1 setting the voltage to high and turning on the power led.

'_delay_ms(1000);'
A function that delays the code by 1 second.

'PORTA &= ~(1 << PA0);'
Sets the A0 bit in PORTA to a 0 setting the voltage to low and turning off the power led.

'_delay_ms(1000);'
A function that delays the code by 1 second.

'}'
Closes the while loop.

'}'
Closes the main function.
