# Arduino_Project_Collection
Collection of my Arduino projects, ranging from simple to advanced. Features source code, circuit diagrams, and project insights. A showcase of my journey in embedded systems and electronics engineering.

ACU.py (Arduino Compiler and Uploader)

This Python script is designed to streamline the development workflow for Arduino projects. It simplifies the process of compiling and uploading C code to an Arduino board. 
The script offers the following features:
Automated File Searching: It searches for a specified .c file within a designated directory and its subdirectories.
Compilation and Conversion: The script compiles the located .c file into an object file (.o), then converts it into an ELF file, and finally into a HEX file.
Efficient Uploading: It uploads the compiled HEX file to an Arduino board using the avrdude tool.
Error Handling: The script includes error handling to inform users of any issues during the command execution process.
User Interaction: Users are prompted to enter the name of their Arduino project .c file and their sudo password for the uploading process.
